FDF is short for ’fil de fer’ in French which means ’wireframe model’

We use MiniLibX, to discover the basics of graphics programming, especially how to place points in space, join them
and, most important, how to see the scene from a specific viewpoint.

This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D land-scape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges)
